- Backend: Flask Python web framework
- Data: JSON-based course information storage

### Data Model
Course structure:
```python
{
    "id": int,
    "title": string,
    "description": string,
    "difficulty": string,
    "duration": string,
    "tags": array,
    "rating": float,
    "students": int
}
```

### Interface Design
- Modern responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Color scheme using CSS variables for consistency
- Interactive components for interest selection and filtering
- Card-based design for course display

## Development & Implementation
